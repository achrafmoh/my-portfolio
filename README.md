Athenaeum OS:
This is the interactive portfolio of Kabrane Mohamed Achraf, a Software Developer and Data Analyst. Built with React and TypeScript, the website is designed as a futuristic "Athenaeum OS" that invites you to explore projects through three distinct personas:
The Architect: Showcasing robust backend systems, full-stack applications, and system design.
The Artist: A gallery of visual design, UI/UX work, and branding projects.
The Analyst: A matrix of interactive data dashboards, AI models, and data-driven insights.
This project is not just a gallery but an immersive experience, demonstrating a passion for building elegant, intelligent, and engaging software solutions.
